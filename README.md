# CLI-set-screen-resolution
Command line program to configure the screen resolution

## Utility
This program let's you configure unsupported resolutions on the fly.

E.g: When you create a Debian 9 VM on VMWare, on a laptop with high screen resolution (e.g: 3840x2160), most probably the VM will not show the right screen configuration. Using this tool settings it up it's trivial.
